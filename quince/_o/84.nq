The date at which the church was founded is unknown as is the original form. It was in existence by the twelfth century. Early eighteenth-century illustrations exist of the church and gate, suggesting a fourteenth-century date. Much of the fine largely fourteenth-century crowde, or lower church (973A) survives. It has two aisles and four bays with tierceron vaulting and good animate and foliate bosses; at the east end of the south aisle is an arched panel with good figure stops and a hexafoil panel. There is evidence of a former fifth bay at the west end of the southern aisle. The remains of an earlier vault survive east of the northern aisle. Beyond is a small vaulted area, used as a charnel house (970A), with two charnel pits (971A), one at each end. Four phases of construction in the crowde - east end of north aisle, running into the charnel house; eastern two full bays of same; western two ditto; the south aisle. In the south wall is the matrix for a 16th. or 17th.century memorial brass. Beyond the south-east corner are the remains of a staircase that linked with the chancel above. John Attwood, Junior, churchwarden, created a vault for burial use in the void between the old and new south walls at the eastern end. He restored the original crypt entrance, there (now the bottom of the fire exit stairs) in 1822. In 1821 a stone coffin was found partly embedded in the north wall (1032A).\nThe mid 14th.century church was demolished in 1762. The church was completely rebuilt above the lower church or crypt 1769 by James Bridges, the steeple and interior being designed by Thomas Paty. Bridges' design, building off the old crypt, was an early and remarkably well-studied attempt at Gothic revival, and the windows have similarities with those of St. Peter's, Peter Street (qv). The interior had a very fine Rococo plaster ceiling by Thomas Stocking. The chancel of the medieval church lay above St. Nicholas Gate, being a number of steps above the nave level. The location of the present tower was formerly a public thoroughfare between St. Nicholas and Baldwin Streets.\nBath stone ashlar and Pennant rubble.\nNave and west tower. Georgian Gothic Revival style.\nWindowless east end projecting to the centre; below a moulded string are rubble crypt walls with quatrefoil openings. 7-bay north elevation (matched on the south), a re-set 15th.century three-light mullion window in the east bay and an inserted 20th.century door to the west of that; tall 5-light Perpendicular windows separated by buttresses up to a blind arcaded parapet. \nThe crypt, or crowde, wall, extended outwards in the 18th.century, is exposed on the south side through the falling ground, and has a gabled porch in the second bay from the west; parapeted vestry (now stairs connecting the two levels) in the south-westcorner has a 4-light south window. \n2-stage tower: the north door has an ogee hood, with 20th.century glazing and small entrance lobby; above is an 8-foil oculus; the belfry has paired windows with ogee hoods, the bottom half blind, the top louvred, and clasping pilaster buttresses, open arcaded parapet, with pinnacles; on the south face is a clock, with a rare second hand (Arch.El.No.972A). Octagonal 3-stage spire with oculi around the middle stage.\nIn crypt a 18th.century baluster-shaped font. A 16th.century wall memorial (John Whitson) with a panelled base, flanking buttresses with pinnacles, an arch over with panelled soffit and an effigy on one elbow (Arch.El.No.974A), at one time in the porch below the tower.\nBurial in the crypt was ended by an Order in Council of 18 February 1854 made under the Burial Act of 1852.\nBombing during the Second World War destroyed the eighteenth-century upper church. The interior was largely rebuilt and the pre-war double gabled roof was replaced by a flat roof. The brass eagle lectern of c1480, William Edney's gates, and the sword rest have all been removed to St. Stephen's Church (qv). The 1822 Whitson monument, sited below the tower, was badly damaged in the Blitz, but portions survive. The church was declared redundant and used as a museum from 1973 until 1993."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The building has a cross-gabled pantile roof with a rendered chimney stack on the western side of the roof.\nInternally the plan of the building appears to have consisted of a single room at the front and at the rear, with a winder stair between the rooms, on the western side of the building. The stair served all floor of the building, including the cellar. By 1875 the building had become a public house known as The Mason's Arms and was recorded in the street directory as being occupied by William Ward.\nThe building has been surveyed by Dr. Roger Leech for the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England (BUAD 2068). One timber crossbeam with a stop survives at ground-floor by the main entrance door and the chimneybreast and stack for the detached kitchen is also extant. Another is extant in the rear room at first-floor level.

Chocolate Factory, located on the southern side of Greenbank Road, Easton. The factory was constructed as a chocolate factory for H. J. Packer and Co. H. J. Packer was a former employee of J. S. Fry, and Packer and Co. was founded as a family business in 1881 at No.46 Armoury Square. H. J. Burrows joined the business as a partner in 1884 and became its sole owner in 1885. Burrows sold the business to Bruce Cole the following year. In the second half of the 1890s the business began to expand and acquired adjacent houses in the terrace.\nExpansion necessitated the construction of a new factory and a site was acquired in Easton. In 1901 plans for a new factory were approved for construction along Co-operation Road.\nThe factory comprised three discrete ranges of brick buildings, each of three storeys and attic with hipped double-Roman tiled roofs, a dormer in the centre of the hip and further small dormers along the length of the roofs. The north-west facing, Co-operation Road, elevations of the eastern and central ranges have five bays while the western range is of three bays. The centre bay of each range consists of large openings for loading doors and the fenestration comprises arched openings containing metal windows. The space between the ranges is covered by ridge lantern lights with steel trusses. Internally the ranges have timber floors with cross-braced joints supported on steel columns. They have king post roofs with tusk tenons, with central steel columns and squared timber posts on either side to support the span.\nTo the east, at the junction of Co-operation Road with Thurley Road, an office building was constructed in c.1918. This is a two-storey, four-bay brick building with a limestone ashlar façade. The ground floor is rusticated and the fenestration consists of large metal windows set in recessed openings. Three bays face south-west on to Thurley Road while the fourth, narrower, bay at the south end, turning the corner into Co-operation Road, contains the main semi-circular arched door opening with an similar arched window above. There is a dentillated cornice with a balustraded parapet above. To the south of the factory was a recreation ground for the workers.\nA fifth range of buildings was added to the eastern side of the factory in the 1950s. The company was acquired by James Goldsmith in 1964 and renamed Cavendish Confectionery. The firm purchased the Camberley-based firm Elizabeth Shaw in 1968 and moved its production to the Greenbank site where it continued until 2006."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The centre bay is set forward slightly and contains the six-panel main entrance door in a rusticated opening. Originally there appear to have been single sash windows on either side of the door. A plat band divided ground from the upper floors. All of the fenestration at first- and second-floor level consisted of sashes.

The roof is hidden behind a parapet.\nThe northern ground-floor bay was removed and replaced with a vehicular entrance door.

The house appears to have been constructed in the seventeenth century and was a jettied, gabled structure of three-storeys and attic with a one-window range. There were a pair of entrances on the west side of the main, north-facing, elevation and the western of these openings contained a seventeenth-century panelled door. The fenestration at ground-floor level originally consisted of a ten-light transomed bay window. At first- and second-floor levels there was glazing across the full-width of the elevation and outer bay windows which had six-light windows in the front and two-light windows in the sides. The panels beneath the windows were decorated. There was an eight-light bay window in the gable at attic level and a pendant below the apex of gable. The building was recorded in a drawing by T. L. Rowbotham made in 1825 (BRSMG M2504) by which time the ground-floor bay had largely been removed. It was demolished in the late 1930s to enable the construction of the inner circuit road."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
