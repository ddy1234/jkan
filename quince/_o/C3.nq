The history of gas works was assessed by Manco (Manco \"Historical Background\" in Gilmore Hankey Kirke 1995) but this account was superceded by the results of a programme of work on the site by RemedX in 1998. This included a review of the documentary history of the site and full rectified photogrammetric survey of the surviving buildings (BUAD 3339). A watching brief was also undertaken in 1998 during groundworks on the site of the Governor House (Erskine 1998).\nSix phases of development were identified the RemedX study (RemedX 1998). During the first phase, from 1824 to 1836, The gas works was created by the Bristol and Clifton Oil Gas Company to produce gas from oil, primarily whale oil. The Plumley and Ashmead's 1828 map of Bristol indicates that the gas works initially occupied only the plot against the east side of Gasferry Road. The production process was housed in a single retort house towards the north end of the site, with a single stone rubble gasholder with a domed roof to the south of this. The upper part of this structure is recorded in a painting of 1837 by W. J. Muller showing Bristol from Clifton Wood (Bristol Museum and Art Gallery K1542). There was also a range of outbuildings. During Phase 2, between 1836 and 1841, the gas works was converted from oil gas to coal gas production when the former became uneconomic. The retort house was modified with new equipment and the range of outbuildings converted into a purifier house. The only surviving fabric from the first two phases of activity is part of the boundary wall along Gasferry Road. During the third phase, 1841 to 1848, the plant was modernised and expanded. Amongst other changes, the site of the ropewalk (BUAD 1282M) on the east side of the gas works was acquired and a larger coal store built there. A new underground Tar and Liquor tank was constructed and new lime purifiers were installed in the purifier house. On the south side of the site, by the north side of Canon's Road, two new gasholders were constructed, as was a landing place for unloading coal was created. In Phase 4, 1848-1860, another acre of land was purchased on the east side of the works and new offices, the main elevation of which is extant in the boundary wall on Canons Road, were constructed overlooking the Floating Harbour. This five-bay building was only a single storey in height. A new gasholder was also built on the newly-acquired land and the Phase 3 coal store converted to a retort house. The Phase 1 gasometer house meanwhile was converted to a purifier house. In 1853 the company was amalgamated with the Bristol Gas Light Company (which operated the Avon Street gas works) to form the Bristol United Gas Company. Phase 5, 1860 to 1870, saw further expansion of the site. The plot on the west side of Gasferry Road was purchased in 1860 and a new purifier house and gasholder erected there. The Phase 1 retort house and gasometer house were demolished along with the Phase 3 gasometers by Canon's Road. The eastern of these was roofed with brick arches to form a new underground liquor tank. Phase 6, 1870-1949, saw the acquisition of more land to the east of the plant. Germaine's timber yard was purchased in 1870 and a second block of land to the east of this probably in the mid- to late-1940s. A new gasholder (No.3) and a new retort house were built, the latter in two phases but completed by 1886. During the twentieth century a carburetted water gas plant, a concentrated liquor plant and a benzole plant were installed. A new jetty for unloading coal from the Floating Harbour was also created. Gas production at the site continued into the post-war period but by 1970 the works were derelict and in 1972 a number of the buildings were demolished.\nWhat remains above ground of the buildings of the first three phases of the gas works is represented in the boundary wall of the site. The buildings on the west side of Gasferry Road, the purifier (ST 57903 72530), the No.1 gas holder (ST 57935 72530) and engine house (ST 57937 72498), date to between 1848 and 1860 but the majority of the surviving structures, almost all to the east of Gasferry Road, date to the period after 1870. These include the purifier house and its 1886 extension (ST 57990 72521), the No.3 gasholder towards the east end of the site (ST 58102 72507), the retort house (ST 58072 72440) and coal store (ST 58085 72473) of 1870 and the engine and dynamo house of 1908 (ST 58033 72487).\nThe purifier houses, retort house and boundary wall have a Grade II listing (Listed Building numbers 501, 504, 508). The remaining elements of the office building are now considered not to be listable. The ground around the gas works was heavily contaminated and was remediated in 2005."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The building was a rendered timber-framed, single-bay house of two storeys and attic and probably dated to the later seventeenth- or early eighteenth-century. The design of No.93 St. Thomas Street was very similar (see the late nineteenth- or early twentieth-century photograph in the Ghey Collection), suggesting that the two were constructed as a pair, and possibly as a part of a terrace of three with the larger No.95 St. Thomas Street (BUAD 1440M).\nBy the end of the nineteenth century at ground-floor level the main, east-facing, elevation on St. Thomas Street comprised part of the frontage of the White Hart public house. However, it retained its original narrow ground-floor window. The first-floor was jettied and had a window opening at the centre. A projecting feature which extended across the full width of the frontages of Nos.93-95 divided second from attic storey. The opening in the attic gable was a slightly smaller and contained a central casement window. The building had a pantiled roof which was half-hipped to the front. There was a large chimney stack, apparently of stone rubble, rising from the north wall. The Goad Fire Insurance plan of January 1887 suggests that in plan the ground floor had a single large room with a yard to the rear. An opening had been created in the centre of the party wall with No.95, although it is not clear whether this alteration was associated with the use of No.95 as a public house or its earlier use as a pottery.\nThe exact date of construction of the building has not yet been established. The 1800 Land Tax assessment records that the property was owned by William Hopkins (Jackson 2001, 5). By the late nineteenth century the house had been incorporated into the White Hart public house. Along with No.95 St. Thomas Street (BUAD 850M) and the two properties to the south, No.94 St. Thomas Street was bought by Samuel Hannam for use as a timber yard and No.94 was subsequently demolished to make way for a new brick warehouse (Jackson 2001). The site was still being used as a timber yard by the early 1950s but the eastern part was was taken for widening of St. Thomas Street in the late 1950s. Much of the site of No.94 St. Thomas Street now lies beneath the highway."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The colliery was in operation by 1854 when the owner was Chick, Keeling & Co.

Ownership of the colliery seems to have changed every few years in the 1860s and 1870s. By 1865 the pit was owned by Chick, Brown & Co. but it was owned by Thomas Brown in the following year, Brown and Harris in 1868, G. W. Harris in 1874 and the Pennywell Colliery Co. in 1877 (Southway 1971, 20). It was acquired by Leonard, Betts & Boult, which already owned the Easton and Hanham collieries, in 1888, though by 1889 the mine was reported as being used only for pumping and ventilation (Ramsey, 2003 24). The date of closure is unclear but Leonard Boult and Company was wound up in 1894.

A lease for building was granted in 1709 and the house had been constructed by 1720 when rates were first collected on it. It is a house of three-storeys and attic with a cellar and a pantile roof. It is constructed of brick with limestone dressings.\nThe main, north-facing, elevation is of five bays with a central entrance door. The ground- and first-floor windows comprise sashes with alternate segmental and triangular pediments above the openings linked by a string course. Internally the entrance hall is divided by an elliptical arch leading to an open dogleg stair. The house has extensive surviving early eighteenth-century features, including panelling in the ground- and first-floor rooms. The structure which is now the Bristol Sailors Home (BUAD 1464M), to the south of the main house, formed the stables for the house, although at least some of the upper floors were probably used as warehouse space.\nBetween c1720 and 1750 a kitchen block was added on the west side of the courtyard and another, smaller, structure on its east side. A lean-to structure, interpreted as a \"necessary\" or former pantry, against exterior of the north wall built as part of the kitchen contained an oculus doorframe with an oval light above. The smaller structure on the east of the courtyard was interpreted as a possible pentice giving covered access to the stables/warehouse.\nIn the mid-eighteenth century, the closet wing at the south-west corner of the house was partly demolished and the line of the wall extended. A service room with a counting house to the north were built on the east side of the courtyard. On the east wall of ground-floor room of the counting house there was a fireplace with a moulded stone chimneypiece dating to the later-eighteenth century and this had a separate boiling hearth on its south side. The counting house itself was probably on the first floor and in this room panelling to dado height survives along with a contemporary cupboard in the south-west corner. There is also a chimneypiece with a moulded overmantel and shelf. The fenestration of the west-facing elevation of this block consisted of segmental-arched window openings.\nDuring the 1850s the stable/warehouse was converted into the Bristol Sailors Home and the elevation to The Grove was reconstructed at that time (BRO 40311/B/1 fol.17; Leech 2002).\nThe building has a Grade II* listing (Listed Building number 901-1/42/204)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The building was a jettied, single-bay structure of two-storeys plus attic with a gabled pantile roof. There was an entrance on the east side of the main elevation at ground floor and a window to its west. A full-width carved beam separated ground and first floor and this carried the date \"1613\". There was a central six-light window at first-floor, and evidence for other possible windows. A full-width carved beam with brackets at either end supported the second-floor jetty and there was a central two-light window at second-floor. The building had carved bargeboards with brackets to the eaves and at the apex of the gable was a decorative finial. The side, north-east facing, elevation of the vicarage was blank but a two-storey side extension with a hipped pantile roof had been added. This had an entrance on the west side of the main elevation, adjacent to that of the vicarage itself, with a shop window. The single first-floor window was a sash.\nThe vicarage was of early seventeenth-century date and G. W. Braikenridge reports that the carved beam at first-floor also carried the initials of Robert Aldworth who was responsible for its construction. By 1825 the building was in use as a shop and was occupied by a basket-maker."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
