The chapel replaced an earlier meeting house and the Rev. John Tommas preached the last sermon in the old building in 1791. The chapel was a three-storey building with hipped roof; three bays; sash windows; entrance on right-hand through double doors, above which is the plaque. The square rainwater head bearing the date 1700, formerly on the west side of the chapel, was re-erected at \"the south top corner of the east wall of the new buildings close by\" (Pritchard 1908, 304). The new Bristol Guide for 1794 refers to the chapel as \"lately rebuilt\". Heath's Guide of 1797 describes the chapel as having \"Galleries on three sides supported by small pillars of Mahogany; and two stout pillars of Freestone, which support the cross Arch of the Roof; the whole spacious and beautiful\".\nThe building was visited by John Pritchard in 1907 shortly before its demolition and he described it as \"a simple brick erection with a name-stone inset over the entrance\". The stone read \"BAPTIST MEETING 1653\"\nHis report is accompanied by a photograph of the front. The building was demolished early in 1907, although it had by then been occupied for some time by Messrs. J. S. Fry & Sons."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The building was probably one of the conventual buildings of the Franciscan Friary. It appears to have been located amongst the buildings on the north side of the cloister and was likely to have been close to the eastern end of the refectory. The function of the building is unclear but a survey by T. S. Pope in 1892 recorded that the building measured 31 feet 6 inches from north to south and 11 feet 6 inches from east to west and the height from ground floor to the ridge of the roof was 29 feet. The elements of the shell walls, including a buttress at first-floor level were of medieval date and at the rear there was an \"outer hall or lobby\" which gave access \"from the ground floor to the land on the higher level\" via a flight of steps (Weare 1893, 33-34). Internally the building appeared originally to have comprised a hall at both ground and first floor. Parts of two Gothic round trefoil windows were extant in the west-facing, Greyfriars, elevation until c.1921. Pope's drawings of these windows were published in Weare (1893).\nBy the early twentieth century the building had been converted into two dwellings. The building was of two storeys and two bays and a pitched pantile roof. In the south facing elevation there were central sashes at first-floor and attic level. The dwellings had adjacent entrances in the west-facing elevation. A tall square brick chimney stack projected from the centre of the eaves above the western elevation. Immediately to the north of this there was a low single-light dormer window.\nBy 1931 (BUAD 2265) the building was ruined. Its site now lies beneath the northern part of the western range of the Whitefriars office block."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

James Ireland, a wealthy merchant from Bristol, bought an estate in Brislington which included the sites of Flowers Hill Farm and Eastwood Farm and built Brislington Hall. The house was a three-storey six-bay building (Winstone 1985, pl337). There was a lodge at the entrance to the drive, five acres of gardens and thirteen acres of parkland. Ireland added to his estate by buying land from William Reeve, the owner of Arno's Court. In 1828, the property was owned by the Ireland Trustees and let to a succession of tenants including  Jacob Ricketts who was listed as the occupier in the Brisington Tithe Award of 1846. Upon his death in 1846 his widow moved into The Elms. In 1856, James Clayfield-Ireland moved into Brislington Hall, having sold Hemplow House (Ireland 1870: BRO St.LB/HM/1a & 1b). The Clayfield family lived in the house until 1923 when the estate passed to a distant cousin who sold it. Brislington Hall was acquired by the haulage contractors, Henry Russett & Sons. The house was then briefly operated as \"The Lido Spa Hotel\" but the venture did not pay and the property was demolished in 1933 (Rowe & Williams 1985).\nThe site was redeveloped for Gallagher's Warehouse, itself demolished in 1984.

Factory, Avonmouth, located on the eastern side of St. Andrew's Road. The factory seems initially to have been established to manufacture the high explosive picric acid. In October 1917 a factory, National Filling Factory No.23 (SMR 21403), had been opened at Chittening to manufacture the blister agent mustard gas (sulphur mustard - 1,1-thiobis(2-chloroethane)) in response to German use of the weapon in the early stages of the Third Battle of Ypres (Passchendaele). Work ceased at Chittening in April 1918 and production was moved to the Avonmouth factory which was converted and extended between May and early June 1918, using equipment originally made for Chittening.\nInitially the factory used the Guthrie high temperature process and the first batch was produced on 15 June. By the end of June 3.5 tonnes of the gas had been manufactured but this production yield was too low. French scientists were approached for advice and recommended adoption of the Levinstein low temperature method. The reaction temperature was reduced to 40 degrees Centigrade in the first half of July and this resulted in improved yields. However, the ethylene unit required complete overhaul in the second half of the month and this resulted in the shutting down of the entire plant. The first acceptable batch of the chemical was produced on 15 August 1918 (Haber 1986, 165-166; Hartcup 1988, 109) but production levels remained low until September 1918.\nThe factory was operational for around six months and had a workforce of 1100. An existing short section of railway was brought into passenger use and the St. Andrew's Road station (SMR 5042) was opened in May 1917 to bring workers to the site. The dangers inherent with the handling of the chemical coupled with the use of porous materials, such as wood and brick, in the construction of the plant led to a high rate of injury amongst the workforce. This was exacerbated by the fact that the factory was still under construction when manufacture began, resulting in \"trying conditions for the workers\" (Anon. 1919, 81). Between 15 June and 15 December 1400 gas casualties were recorded at the Avonmouth factory (Haber 1986, 249) including three fatalities. Around 700 workers were affected, \"some of whom had three or four attacks,\" and the sickness resulting included \"blisters on every part of the body (except the palms of the hands), conjunctivitis, bronchitis, etc., and chronic effects of debility, cough, gastric pain and breathlessness\" (Anon. 1919, 81). The Avonmouth factory ceased production at 8:00pm on 11 November 1918. In all, the factory produced 560 tons of mustard gas, and 416 tons of this were deemed acceptable for shell filling (Haber 1986, 166).\nThe layout of the factory is currently uncertain but most of the original factory buildings appear to have been demolished. However, the administration building of the factory is extant. This is a two-storey brick structure with ashlar quoins. The building is orientated north south and has an H-shaped plan. The main element of the building has a central porch with a single doorway with ashlar detailing, including a pediment. It has a hipped roof with tall square projecting brick chimneystacks. There are a number of other surviving structures, including sheds, which may have been associated with the factory. There are also known to have been several reactors and the site was served by an internal electric railway. Three of the battery-powered locomotives were acquired by the Hythe Pier Railway (one being used for spares) where they still operate."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The building was designed by T. Cecil Howitt and opened on 16 July 1938, having cost £57,600 to construct. It had 1945 seats, 1051 in the stalls and another 894 in the balcony. The cinema had a corner entrance with a circular tower above which contained five recessed windows. The entrance foyer was circular and there was an octagonal double-height foyer which was apparently unique amongst Odeon cinemas. A promenade at first-floor level led to the balcony (Eyles 2002, 186-189). The cinema was damaged by bombing on 3 December 1940 and closed briefly, re-opening on 17 December 1940. In 1967 the building was modernised and it was converted to three screens in May 1974, with 844 seats in the former balcony and 108 and 103 in the former stalls. The cinema was closed again in October 1983 for redevelopment of the interior to a design by the architect Donald Armstrong of Downton & Hurst. A new shop was created in the ground floor and the entrance moved to the side. The cinema reopened on 13 June 1985 with three screens seating 400, 225 and 215 respectively (Eyles 2002, 249-250).
