In 877 two fields of the Southmead estate, Marland Grove and Little Marland Grove, were sold to the Guardians of the Poor of the Barton Regis Union in 1898. A new workhouse was constructed on the site in 1902 to a design by A. P. I. Cotterell and W. H. Thorpe (Morrison 1999, 204).\nThe entrance to the site was off Southmead Road and adjacent to the road were two groups of buildings, offices on the north-east side of the entrance and the casual and receiving wards on the south-west side. This included the disinfecting house and a stone yard to the south side. A drive led between these buildings, along an avenue of pollarded elms with cultivation beds on its northern and southern sides, to the Master's House. This was the central of three ranges of buildings with the men's block to its north-east and the women's block to the south-west. The kitchen and laundry were to the rear of these ranges and to the north was the married couple's quarters. The earliest buildings were typically constructed of squared Pennant sandstone blocks with limestone ashlar detailing."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
