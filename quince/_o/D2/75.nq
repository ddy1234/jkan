The monument was identified during an archaeological evaluation in 1993 (SMR 20029). Four postholes cut into the underlying red sandy clay subsoil, each 0.33 metres in diameter and 0.25 metres deep, were excavated on the south-west quadrant of the circle. The timber circle  was approximately 7 metres in diameter. No stratification associated with contemporary human activity within or outside the monument was recorded and the postholes were sealed by a brown loamy clay containing ceramics of thirteenth- to fourteenth-century date. However, the fill of the postholes produced worked flint flakes and one lump of a material described by the excavator as a possible metallic ore.\nThe function of the monument was not established but the excavator suggested that it might be interpreted as a simple roundhouse."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
