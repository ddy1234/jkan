The building is the southernmost of a terrace of nineteen houses. The plot, formerly part of the grounds associated with Clifton Hill House, was leased from the Society of Merchant Venturers by Harry Elderton in 1792 for a term of forty years (Ison 1952, 234). Construction of the terrace began under the supervision of William Paty (Priest 2003, 101) but was abandoned in 1793 when the outbreak of war caused a slump in development. The buildings remained uncompleted for nearly two decades but the terrace had apparently been completed by 1815.\nThe building is a rendered three-storey house with attic and basement. It has a slate mansard roof. A raised walk on the east side of the building extends the full length of the terrace.\nIn 1882 the building was occupied by Henry Humphries.\nThe building has a Grade II listing (Listed Building number 901-1/41/6)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
