The date of foundation of the church is not clear but the fabric of the present building dates from the fifteenth century. The north aisle and arcade rebuilt 1819. The church was described by Sir Stephen Glynne in April 1850 (SMR 5745) as consisting of a \"nave, and chancel, with aisles to the former and south aisles only to the latter, a west tower and south porch\" with mainly Decorated Gothic features. Glynne also noted the shaft of the cross in the churchyard (McGarvie 1994, 49-50). A watercolour by John Buckler executed in 1828 in the Piggott collection records the church from the south-east. The church is constructed of coursed red and grey Pennant sandstone rubble with ashlar dressings and stone-coped slate roofs. The eastern end was rebuilt in 1874 by B. Ferrey.\nThe interior dates predominantly to the late-nineteenth century with a fifteenth-century archway.\nThe building has a Grade II* listing (Listed Building Number 901-1/49/452)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
