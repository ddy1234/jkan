The fourth house is oriented east-west and aligns with the north walls of the three other houses. On the south side of the buildings were gardens. It is not clear whether these buildings were associated with the two limekilns shown to the west. Recording work inside Nos.10-14 Cheese Lane at the end of 1995 recognised plan elements of these buildings in the fabric of the existing buildings at the east side of the site, but could not determine to what extent the fabric of seventeenth-century houses survived."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
