<http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/resource/Bristol_Monuments.csv/row_503> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/definition/monument_desc> "A house located on the north side of Crow Lane, immediately west of a nineteenth-century warehouse which stood on the corner of Crow Lane and Welsh Back. The building was a four-storey, two-bay jettied and gabled building with a pantile roof. There were cellar lights on either side of what appears to be two doorways side by side and centrally-placed in frontage. This appears originally to have been two, single-bay, properties (possibly built as part of the same development) and later made into one. The string lines are continuous across the facade at all levels. The ground floor is a shopfront. The windows in the upper floors were sashes, while windows in each of the gable ends seem to have had drip moulds above them.\nThe buildings were demolished sometime during the first decade of the twentieth-century."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
