It was probably constructed in the seventeenth century. The west-facing elevation facing on to Park Road had been replaced, apparently in the early-eighteenth century. The new façade is of two-storey height and is in a classical style. There were three bays with ashlar mouldings forming segmental-headed arches. The central arch contained a doorway and those on either side small windows. At the shoulder of the arches is an impost-band and the arches have keystones. Above these is a plat band and above this there is a smaller segmental-headed arch and on either side a circular moulding.

The site now lies largely below an open area on the west side of the Back, immediately south of the 'Brygstowe' office block, and north-east of another at No.15-21 Queen Charlotte Street. In 1905 it was learned that many of the architectural details were to be removed to a new residence in Hampshire, designed by Edwin Lutyens. \nThe building was recorded internally by Philip E. W. Street in 1931, with annotated sketch plans made on March 18th. and internal photographs taken the following day. He noted that the first-floor room facing the Back had been the \"Drawing-room\", with, apparently, a fireplace on the north wall; behind was another, unidentified, room; behind again, a modern office with skylight; to the rear, to the north the main staircase, to the south the \"South Room\". This last had an \"Elizabethan\" window in its east wall (i.e.against the modern office), with a fireplace of similar attribution at an angle in the south-east corner. Immediately west was the \"West Room\", with, on its west side, a passage which turned west at its north end to reach Queen Charlotte Street. In the west wall of the room were (south) \"jambs of Elizabethan window\" and (north end) \"Elizab. panelled door\", the latter above a similar feature on the ground-floor. A fireplace had formerly been located along the north wall of the west room. In the south wall of the adjacent property to the north, No.11 Welsh Back, and against the second room of Langton's House, were several blocked-up \"Elizabethan\" windows. \nThe front was recorded by Robert Harman in 1732, when Arthur Taylor, mayor, occupied the house. His drawing was copied by H. O'Neill in 1821. As late as 1810 the left-hand entrance and two columns were still standing. In that year there was a fire in the building.\nO'Neill shows a house of two bays, a 3-window range. Three storeys and attics. Entrances with semicircular heads to left and right, between single columns; low pairs of gates before the single panelled doors; wider central arched opening. Full-width parapet at first-floor, above the columns, with urns, etc., as decoration. Large central 15-light window with double transom; to either side, canted bays of 9-lights to front, 3 to each side, parapets. Second-floor possibly flush with first. Oriel to centre, single transom, 6 lights, 4 each to sides, parapet; either side 6-light windows. Balustraded parapet at attic level, with access door below central valley. A cross-window in either gable. Twin gables to front; cross gable, with stacks either end. Observatory platform in centre of roof, balustraded. Gables possibly slated. \nInside was a fine staircase, drawn by O'Neill in 1821 (M2266), carved balusters, and square newel posts surmounted by beasts. The fine full-height chimney-piece was drawn by Johnson in 1823 (M2268); Rowbotham recorded the doorway and panelling in 1826 (M2269-2271)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

Richard Frank left his pottery in Redcliff for this new location and seems to have amalgamated his business with the next door Water Lane pottery [BUAD 87M]. Joseph Ring took over the business in after marrying Frank's daughter Elizabeth and, with the help of Anthony Hassells, the pottery began to produce \"Queen's Ware,\" a cream -coloured earthenware, in 1786. Ring died in April 1788 and the business was taken over by his brother Robert Ring and Henry Carter. Joseph Ring II and John Decimus Pountney came into the partnership in 1813 and the firm traded as Pountney and Carter until Pountney's death in 1852. In 1822 the pottery consisted of ranges of buildings arranged around four kilns, two adjacent gloss kilns and two biscuit kilns. This arrangement was retained into the early 1880s when it was recorded by the 1:500 Ordnance Survey first edition plan. The throwing room was on the west side of the kilns while the Dripping and Placing Room, the Hot House and the Enamel kiln were on their north side. A yard separated these buildings from the Plate Makers, Dish Makers shops and the Gig Room. The Mill Houses and steam engine were along the south-east boundary of the site. The pottery closed in 1886 and the centre of the site had been redeveloped by August 1896 as a Day Industrial School. The site is now occupied by The Crescent Centre."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The school was constructed in 1835 and is recorded by the tithe survey of Clifton made in 1844 (BRO EP/A/32/12). It was a large two-storey structure with a hipped roof and occupied a footprint measuring 29 metres east-west by 13 metres north to south on an apparently specially constructed terrace. The main, south-facing, elevation was of nine bays and had tall, narrow windows to both floors, those of the first-floor having segmental-headed arches. The side east-facing, elevation had three bays. Plans in Bristol Record Office (BRO 229389(6 & 7)) indicate that the ground-floor was largely occupied by a single teaching space. At the western end of the building were two smaller rooms and a lodge projected from the building at ground floor. The stairs to the first-floor were at the south-eastern corner of the building. The first-floor was largely occupied by the girls school with a smaller teaching area divided off by partitions at the head of the stair.\nBy 1883 an extension had been added to the eastern end of the building. This was intended as an Infants School and the Girls school was later also moved into the building. It measured 20 metres from east to west by 10 metres north-south and was a single-storey structure with a pitched roof and basement. The side, south-facing, elevation was of five bays with tall windows with segmental-headed arches and ashlar dressings. Immediately beneath the windows there was a projecting moulded freestone ashlar string course, with a second around 0.5 metres below this. The parapets at the east and west ends of the roof also had ashlar dressings. A single-storey block linking the two school buildings contained the latrines.\nThe school building survived into the twentieth-century and were damaged by bombing in the early 1940s. The structure remained in ruins throughout the 1950s and the site was subsequently redeveloped. However, the gymnasium, apparently dating to the first two decades of the twentieth century, survives as do elements of the main school building in the succeeding structure (Parry, 2001)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
