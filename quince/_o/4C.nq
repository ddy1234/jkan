The main elevation faced west on to Haymarket and in most photographs of the building the ground-floor is obscured by foliage and its form is therefore unknown at present. However, it was presumably occupied by a shop. The fenestration at first floor and attic level comprised a single sash and above the first-floor window there was a large painted signboard extending across the full-width of the building. The roof was pantiled. There was a passageway leading to a rear yard along the north side of the building.\nThe building was demolished in 1953 or 1954.

The business was founded by John Ring in partnership with Frederick Cookworthy in 1802 (Price et al., 1984 264) and a factory established \"opposite George's Deal Yard\" on Temple Back. The factory was gutted by a fire so that, according to the Bristol Mirror of 27th July 1811, \"in little more than an hour nothing more than bare walls were left standing\" but was soon operating again. In 1817 Ring's partnership with Cookworthy was dissolved and Ring took over the running of the factory alone until his death in August 1818. The business and premises were auctioned and may have been bought by a William Bissix (Price et al., 1984 267). The business was taken on by John Ring's elder brother Richard Frank Ring who built a factory - the Ohio Tobacco-Pipe Manufactory - on the north side of Commercial Road at Temple Back which exported pipes to the Caribbean, the east coast of the United States, Canada and Ireland. By 1861 the business had become Richard Charles Ring & Co. although its interests diversified considerably and by 1884 the factory had apparently been sold to Hawley & Co. The factory was vacant at the time of a fire insurance survey in August 1896 and the second edition Ordnance Survey map of 1902 indicates that the factory had, by then, been demolished.\nSome archaeological work has taken place on the site since the 1980s. Part of a muffle kiln from the factory was recovered during excavation of a service pipe in the mid 1980s [BUAD 3313] by Reg Jackson (Egan, 1984 318-319; Peacey, 1996 33-34). Part of the site was excavated in 1995 [BUAD 517] by Rod Burchill (Burchill, 1995; Williams, 1996 86). Large-scale office development at Temple Quay in the late 1990s destroyed most of the monument and only small elements, if anything, will remain."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

A town gate which stood at the top of St. John's Steep. A minor gate, it was possibly a later addition to the defensive line. The gate itself consisted of a plain segmental arch to the outer, or north, side and was accompanied, west, by a small turret or barbette, the Dove Tower [390M]. The arch was constructed of stone rubble, with the segmental arch on the southern, inside, face of moulded freestone while on the outside removal of the render revealed a plain stone arch with voussoirs, apparently of Pennand sandstone above. By the early nineteenth century there was a 2-storey house with mansard roof built above the arch. O'Neill's drawings show the gate to be about twice the width of the 6/6 pane sashes in the house above. \nSeyer (1821, 266-267) noted that the town wall was about 10 feet thick at this point. In 1888 it was noted that the gate was \"so nearly covered with modern buildings that only a fragment of the gate itself is visible.\" The gate and house were removed in March 1911. The demolition was photographed at successive stages by the local photographer Fred Little and observed by John Pritchard; a number of finds were recovered."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The building forms part of terrace, Nos.7-13 Portland Square and was a house of three storeys plus attic with a mansard roof. The main, north-west facing elevation is of limestone ashlar and has three bays. The ground floor is rusticated and the upper two floors plain. The interior of the building collapsed in the 1980s and only the façade survives from the original building. At either end of the mansard, projecting from the party walls, there is a brick chimney stack. The other walls are of Pennant sandstone rubble. Cellars extended beneath the house and there is a basement lightwell at the front of the house. On the northern side of this smaller cellars extend under the road.\nPortland Square was laid out in the late 1780s and building plots were advertised for sale from March 1790. The plots of Nos.11 and 12 Portland Square were acquired for development by James Lockier but Lockier's went into bankruptcy when the building boom collapsed in 1792. The building was completed by the architect Daniel Hague in 1811. The sale advertisement of 1812 stated that the buildings comprised \"three arched underground cellars, a servants hall, housekeeper's room, back-kitchen, larder, brew-house, and other offices, on the area floor; an entrance hall, front parlour twenty feet by twenty-two feet, two back parlours, and a garden on the ground floor; a drawing room twenty one feet by twenty seven, and two other rooms on the first storey; four rooms and a water closet on the attic storey; and four rooms on the upper storey\" (quoted in Ison, 1952 221). Ashmead's plan of the 1850s indicates that the building had apparently only half the length of the adjoining buildings in the terrace. The rear part may therefore have been demolished by that date or the building may never have been of the same size. The building had gone out of domestic use by the later nineteenth century and was part of the Young & Melrow Stay and Corset factory by 1877.\nThe building has a Grade I listing (Listed Building number 901-1/6/1901)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

Rowbotham in 1829 (BUAD 1832; BRSMG Mb6398) when it was occupied by a druggist. The ground floor of the main elevation was a shopfront with a central doorway. The first-floor fenestration comprised a canted bay, with a large central sash and small sashes on each side. On either side of the bay there was pargetting or moulded plasterwork. The pargetting on either side of the bay at first floor had central elliptical panels, the western containing the letters \"ID\" and the eastern the date \"1663\". The plasterwork was very similar in style to that of No.7, suggesting that the work on the two buildings was executed at the same time and for the same owners. The second floor extends into the roof space and has a central twin sash window in the same plane as the rest of the gable end. The decorative plasterwork did not extend above first-floor. There was a chimney stack on the east side of the roof.\nThe building survived into the early twentieth century.

The church appears to have been constructed in the later twelfth century and served as a chapel of ease to St. John's Church, Bedminster.\nThe upper stages of the spire toppled into the nave during a storm in the fifteenth century, probably in the winter of 1446, and it remained truncated for several centuries.\nIn 1468 William Canynges created a perpetual chantry in the chapel of St. George and installed Thomas Hallkesock as the chaplain (Berkeley Muniments A2/17/38).\nA heavy tenor bell of approximately 39 cwt was cast by Purdue in 1622 (it was removed in 1903).\nThe Canynges Society was founded in 1848 to raise funds for restoration works to the church. The spire was rebuilt in the 1870s with funding from a public subscription organised by the Canynges Society, and the reconstruction was completed in 1872. The Society was then dissolved but it was reconstituted in 1972.\nIn 1910 with Messrs. Harrison and Harrison, of Durham and London, rebuilt the organ. The new organ occupied the same position on each side of the chancel as the previous one but because of restricted space, the console was detached and sited just west of the chancel arch on the north side of the nave.\nThe church has a Grade I listing (Listed Building number 901-1/42/1687) while the churchyard wall and the head of the Redcliff pipe is listed Grade II (Listed Building number 901-1/42/1682)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

It was designated as a private burial ground in 1811 and bought by the community from the estate of Isaac Jacobs in 1830 (Samuel 1997, 74). The burial ground was closed in the early part of the nineteenth-century. In 1850 the burial ground was described as \"very small and narrow; house windows overlook it. The soil is marshy, and the whole in a very dirty and neglected state, being used as the back premises of the dwelling-house through which it is entered\" (Clark 1850, 165). An Order in Council of 18 February 1854 made under the Burial Act of 1852 imposed the restriction that \"only one body [was] to be buried in each grave\" in the burial ground and the cemetery was shown as disused on the 1st edition Ordnance Survey map of the early 1880s. The plot was compulsorily purchased by the Great Western Railway in May or June 1913 to allow for the construction of a new goods shed (built c.1926). The human remains and memorials were removed to a new burial ground in Fishponds in the early 1920s (Samuel 1997, 78)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The house was of medieval date, although its form as built is unknown. It did, however, have a timber roof with semi-circular windbraces of late-medieval date supported on contemporary stone corbel heads. The building appears to have been subject to some alteration during the seventeenth century, including the installation of a strapwork-decorated chimney-piece.\nThe late-medieval roof was truncated and by c.1875 when it was identified only one bay at the rear of the property consisting two principal rafters and semi-circular windbraces remained. The roof was removed c.1899 and at about the same time the two fifteenth-century corbel heads were moved to another position in the building. In 1909 the corbels were removed from the building and presented to Bristol Museum (Pritchard 1911, 72-74).\nThe building was demolished in May 1910 to make way for an extension to Messrs.
