The building was a house constructed in the mid-seventeenth century. It was of three storeys and attic and probably had a common rafter roof.\nNo.14 (BUAD 170M) and No.15 King Street were amalgamated into a single warehouse during the nineteenth century and a new façade created. This is of Pennant sandstone ashlar and squared rubble, with red brick and limestone dressings and has a four-window range. The ground-floor windows are in segmental-arched openings while the upper floor is divided by four two-storey semicircular-arched recesses, with alternate brick and limestone dressings. Several of the internal walls of both buildings appear to have been removed at the same time to create open-plan spaces and cast-iron columns (with flanges to pillows and timber floor beams) seven bays deep support the first-floor. The seventeenth-century second and third floors were also removed and a new floor for the warehouse inserted at a level between them.\nThe northern part of the seventeenth century building is in part extant. The former west wall of No.15 survives and contains a seventeenth-century chimney breast. The roof against the street front is hipped with a gable at its south end.\nThe building has a Grade II listing (Listed Building number 901-1/16/600)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
