Gough, and was to commemorate the quatrcentenary of John Cabot's voyage to Newfoundland.\nThe first stone was laid by the Marquis of Dufferin and Ava in 1897. The foundations were dug into the underlying Brandon Hill Grit, disturbing inhumations and other archaeological features. The tower stands 105 feet [32.1 metres] high is of red sandstone rubble with limestone dressings and is in a Tudor Gothic Revival style. It is a square two-stage tower with diagonal buttresses.

The doorway in the north side has a moulded surround and plain door, below a two-centred arched panel with a gabled label, crockets and finial, containing the city arms. There is an ashlar octagonal spirelet on top, and a ball finial with a carved figure above.\nThe Marquis of Dufferin opened the monument on 6th September 1898. Originally there was a cannon on each side of the projecting base of the tower. The gardens which now surround the base are a later addition.\nThe tower has a Grade II listing (Listed Building number 901-1/41/18)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
