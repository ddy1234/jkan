The cinema was converted from the Triangle Hall skating rink by Frank Wilkins for Emmanuel Harris to a design by W. H. Watkins (Ewins 1984, 27). The cinema opened in 1914 with two storeys and a spherically fronted pillared entrance on its north east corner. Harris later added a balcony and an open café from which the screen could be viewed (Anderson 1983, 32-33; 61). The cinema was run in the 1930s in conjunction with the Whiteladies Picture House by Triangle and Whiteladies Picture Houses Ltd. (Ewins 1984, 27).\nThe cinema was destroyed by bombing in 1940."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
