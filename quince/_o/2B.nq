Elements of the park may be medieval in origin, since this was part of the estate of the adjacent Abbey of St. Augustine. At the creation of the diocese of Bristol in 1542 the lands of the former abbey were divided between the Bishop and the Dean and Chapter. The Abbot's Lodging and the Abbot's Park were granted to the Bishop. The park is recorded by James Millerd's 1673 map while Jean Rocque's 1742 'A Plan of the City of Bristol' shows the \"BISHOP'S PARK\" bounded by Cow or Limekiln Lane, the Rope Walk at Canons Marsh, and the rears of buildings fronting College Green and Lower College Green. Towards the south-western end of the park the plan shows three ponds (BUAD 1060A-1062A), the northern (a fishpond?) being the largest, triangular in shape, perhaps dammed at its southern end, while the others were irregular, one of them connected with the large drainage ditch that ran along the northern edge of Canons Marsh. No evidence of the largest pond was found during archaeological excavation on its putative site on the south side of Deanery Road.\nIn March 1770 the then Bishop of Bristol, Thomas Gooch, leased the Park to Samuel Worrall who was to develop it with housing: \"The said close of ground should be improved by buildings to be erected theron and whereas the said Samuel Worrall hath formed a plan for covering the said close of ground with buildings to which plan there is a street called College Street of the breadth of forty feet from front to front of the second story of the intended houses out of which is taken three feet for areas or bow windows on the first story or ground floor and five feet for a paved foot-way which leaves twenty four feet carriage. \" (BRO DC/E./40/28/2). The main sewer to serve the housing was reported to have been completed in September 1770 (Ison 1952, 210) and 1775 eight houses in College Street were occupied according to Sketchley's directory of Bristol. The leases on the individual properties reverted to the Bishop and in 1853 he issued a new lease to William Tanner, a property speculator (BRO 21054(2)). The Bishop sold his interest in the Park to Tanner in May 1871 (BRO 21054(7)). The land remained in a single ownership until June 1950 when the individual plots composing the estate were sold at auction (BRO 21054 (17))."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

A small mortuary chapel had by then been built at the centre of the burial ground (at ST 59264 73721). Surrey Lodge (BUAD 1700M) was built subsequently.

The Dean and Chapter leased a plot at the south-east corner of the square to James Greene in 1611 (BRO DC/E/40/28/1) and the building was constructed on this plot in the seventeenth century. It was a single-bay jettied, gabled house of three storeys and the front (north-facing) and side (west-facing) elevations of the building were rendered. The ground floor contained a central entrance doorway and the jetty above was supported on four equally-spaced columns. The ground floor was divided from first floor by a narrow full-width pentice. The fenestration at first floor comprised a single five- by three-pane timber casement window. On the east side of the building there was a projecting element with a hipped pantile roof which extended only up to second floor. This was apparently square and was in front of the façade of the two-storey building attached to the east side. The function of this projecting element is unclear and it was divided from the rest of the façade by a timber pilaster, although it would appear to have been part of the original design of the building. The pediment dividing first- from second-floor did not extend across the full-width of the main elevation at this level, terminating at the eaves of the hipped element of the roof. The second floor fenestration was a wide five- by two-pane casement. There was no window in the attic gable. The roof was pantiled with a three-flue brick stack in the ridge of the roof at the rear of the building. On the west side of the building there was a gateway of coursed squared rubble stone, the main, north-facing,elevation was rendered with what appear to have been ashlar facings. This led to a path around the east and south sides of a walled garden belonging to the building to the west.\nBy 1825 the building had become the Black Horse public house. The building was demolished not long after 1890 along with the other structures on the south side of College Square. The site of the building now lies mainly beneath Anchor Road."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

Cartographic evidence, notably Plumley and Ashmead's survey of Bristol in 1828 and Ashmead's mid-nineteenth century 1:600 plans, indicate that there were also a number of ancillary buildings within the shipyard.\nIt was taken over by John Green in 1815 and a painting by T. L. Rowbotham made in 1825 (BUAD 1945; BRSMG M2923) records the entrance to the dock and the drawbridge over the gates. The dock survived until 1883 when it was bought by the City Corporation and filled in. The Ordnance Survey first edition 1:500-scale plan (Bristol Sheet LXXV.4.4), however, indicates that the gates and footbridge survived for a short time after the infilling was complete.\nRowe's leadworks (BUAD 1199M) was developed on the site of the dock in 1884."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/ddy1234/jkan/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
